##Run_analyis.R

Initially the given data set is read one by one by using read.table() command. Then column names are given to each table.
The data is then merged using cbind,rbind function and is named as final_dataset. The final_dataset is then made smaller by sub-setting only those columns which were required.
In the end a separate dataset called Tidy_data is created which calculates the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Code book
