# _Word Predictor_  
## [Capstone Project Info](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-project/#syllabus) 
The goal of this capstone is to mimic the experience of being a data scientist. As a practicing data scientist it is entirely common to get a messy data set, a vague question, and very little instruction on exactly how to analyze the data. Our goal is to give you that same experience but with added support in the form of forums, discussion with instructors, feedback from SwiftKey and Coursera engineers, and a structured problem to solve. We hope that you will take advantage of the opportunity this project affords for you to demonstrate your skills and creativity.

## Course Tasks

This course will be separated into 8 different tasks that cover the range of activities encountered by a practicing data scientist. They mirror many of the skills you have developed in the data science specialization. The tasks are:

- Understanding the problem   
- Data acquisition and cleaning  
- Exploratory analysis  
- Statistical modeling  
- Predictive modeling  
- Creative exploration  
- Creating a data product  
- Creating a short slide deck pitching your product

# _Forecasting Application_  
This application is used to check forecast for given data. The value of forecast can be seen on interactive graph produced by each forecasting method.

# _Introduction to Machine Learning project_
The task is to predict different classes like walking, running etc based on data of their personal activities collected using devices like fitbit.

# _Getting and Cleaning Data_
The task is to read text file into dataframe and clean the data, i.e removove the missing values, renaming variables to proper names and saving the data in csv for later use.

# _Regression Models_
The task is carry out simple regression on cars data set and answer the following questions.  
You are required to explore the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome).
  
1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?  
2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions
